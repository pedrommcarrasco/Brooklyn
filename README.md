2. Open **Brooklyn.saver** (double click)
3. `"Brooklyn.saver" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer` will appear, press `OK`

## Troubleshooting ü§ï

The Brooklyn screen saver can be blocked by the system as a malicious software. Sometimes on macOS Big Sur clicking `Open Anyway` in `Security & Privacy` is not fixing the issue.  

To bypass this quarantine made by apple, you can use this command in your terminal :

```shell
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/"Library/Screen Savers/Brooklyn.saver"
```
